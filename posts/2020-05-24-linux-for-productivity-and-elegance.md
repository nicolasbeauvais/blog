Linux is a wonderful piece of software with some of the best tools and development productivity apps out there. 
But as with every thing that you get to use 10h a day, it can start to get a bit boring to work with, I personally
do not like staring at small green text on a black terminal, and if Apple had less vendor lock-in and more open 
hardware I would probably not be writing this today, but here I am. If you like your Linux raw, and there is nothing
wrong with that, this blog series is probably not for you.

In the other end, if you want to learn how to make your own flavor of Linux by changing, step by step, 
how everything looks and feel, and learn more about how it works in the process, this blog series has been written
for you, so keep on reading, and welcome to the world of customized Linux desktop, also known as 
[Linux Ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/8vcdwb/what_is_ricing/).

This will not be a classic tutorial, my goal with this series is to show you what is possible by sharing the best
resources I curated over the internet to customize each piece of your Linux desktop environment, most example will
rely on Debian and I3, but you will hopefully have everything in hand to fine tune any Linux distro, with the window
manager of your choice.

Finally, this guide is not intended for Linux beginner as in my opinion you should first learn the basics first before 
changing everything, or expert, as I'm far from one, you will probably get bored by reading all this! If you're 
somewhere in the middle you might be able to learn a thing or two, and hopefully push your Linux knowledge to the next 
level!
